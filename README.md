# Risk Game

Risk Game is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest for two to four players. This version is played
on a board depicting a political map of the world, divided into six territories, which display the common continents.

### Basic Idea

<ul>
<li>Turns rotate among players who control troops of playing pieces with which they attempt to capture territories from other players, with results by dice rolls.</li>
<li>The goal of the game is to occupy every territory on the board and eliminate the other players.</li>
</ul>

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will
start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
